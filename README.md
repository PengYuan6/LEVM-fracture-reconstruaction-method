# LEVM：A Multi-device Data fusion Method for Rock Tensile Fracture Reconstruction 
This repository provides open-source code and datasets for a three-dimensional rock fracture reconstruction method. The associated manuscript has been submitted to IJRMMS.

The overall workflow of the proposed method is illustrated in the figure. Its core advantages can be summarized as follows:

- By integrating the complementary strengths of CT imaging and 3D scanning, two relatively low-cost and individually lower-precision devices are effectively combined to achieve a more accurate reconstruction of three-dimensional fracture geometry.
- Only local CT scanning of the fracture region is required to recover the complete tensile fracture structure.
- The reconstructed fracture geometry is well suited for subsequent hydro-mechanical simulations.
